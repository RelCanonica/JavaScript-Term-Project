    GAME DESCRIPTIONS
------------------------------
1)  Catcentration is a game based on the card game concentration. You flip over one card at a time. If the second card you select matches the first card you select, they are removed from the board. If not, both cards are flipped back over, and you start again. Play continues until all cards are removed.

2)  Purrzzles is a puzzle game. You click and drag puzzle pieces to fit the shape of the outline provided to form a picture of a cat. 

3)  Feline Facts is a quiz game. For each question, you select an answer. If you answer correctly, you earn 1 point. The goal is to earn as many points as possible, with the highest score being 10 points.

     CURRENT PROGRESS
------------------------------
1) Catcentration hasn't been started yet

2) Purrzles is complete. I'd like to add a "snap" function at a later date, but it currently functions as intended.

3) Feline Facts is in progress. I have the content done and the slider set up to click through questions. I need to still code functionality for correct and incorrect answers, and format the points system.
